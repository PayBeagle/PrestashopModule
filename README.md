Hosted Form Module for PrestaShop
=================================


**Step 1:**

Copy the 'paybeagle' folder into the 'modules' directory inside your Prestashop Web Directory.
(On most servers this is '/var/www/html/')

**Step 2:**

Log in to the Admin area of PrestaShop, then from the left menu, click Modules. Next, type 'paybeagle' into the search box on the left.
Wait a few moments for 'PayBeagle Hosted Payments' to appear on the right, and click the green 'install' button.

**Step 3:**

From here, you are ready to test payments in the sandbox environment. Our default sandbox credentials are already populated for you.
Once you have tested a payment to see what the transition from your website to our payment page looks like, you should contact us to create a Sandbox account, and tell us the three URLs listed in the module control panel.
